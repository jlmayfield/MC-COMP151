### Homework 1
#### COMP 151 - Spring 2021

For this homework set you'll be exploring data encoding through a few problems from chapter 1.  Answer the problems on paper, scan them to a PDF file, and submit them on Gradescope. Most of your work will be done in python files, but we will need to do pencil and paper work from time to time so this is practice for that. A really easy way to scan documents to PDF is with the app Camscanner (see link below). Alternatively, you can type your answers and save or export the document to PDF format.

Do the following problems: 1.3, 1.4, 1.5,  1.8. 1.14, 1.17 & 1.18
