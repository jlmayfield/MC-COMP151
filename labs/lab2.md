For your second lab you'll be working be getting used to the basics of image manipulation. Don't forget that at the end of chapters 2 and 4 there are a *Programming Summary* sections that provides a quick dictionary of all of the important function and type names introduced thus far. When you run into problems don't forget to check the *Common Bugs* and *Debugging Tips* scattered throughout the chapters as well.

From Chapter 4 do the following problems: 
* Switch the *driver* (person typing the code) and *navigator* (person watching, helping spot typos, etc.) on every new problem.

 When you're done or when time is up, whichever comes first, print the code from 2.27 and 2.29 and hand it in along with your hand written comments for each problem.
