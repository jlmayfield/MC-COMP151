# Working with sound

In this lab you get your feed wet with sound data. The programming fundamentals
are the same, but you'll need to learn to work with sound, collections of samples,
rather than images, collections of pixels.

## To Do

Do the following problems from chapter 7:
1. 7.7
2. 7.8
3. 7.11
4. 7.12

The programming summary that starts o page 230 is an excellent reference for the basic functions needed for working with sound.
