\section{Remote Learning Expectations}

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this course will be delivered remotely. The plan
is to retain most of the regular meetings and opporotunities for help and direct instrution
but to carry out these activities via online tools. Here's what that means, what you can expect,
and what will be expected of you for this mode of delivery.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Remote contact information for the instructor and Zoom meeting links will be posted to the
  course Moodle.

  \item Assignments will be posted and submitted via Moodle or a similar online platform.

  \item Class and Lab sessions will meet at the usual time but will be carried out
  via Zoom. \textit{Attendance expectations for these sessions are the same as
  if the class were meeting in person.}

  \item Prior to class meetings, students will be given reading assignments and possibly
  pre-recorded videos to watch. A short reading quiz and homework problems will often
  accompany the assignment as well. These assignments are expected to be done prior to
  class and will be the way you can expect to encounter and explore new ideas in the course.
  Class meetings and lab sessions will be used to clarify these ideas and test our
  shared understanding of these ideas through additional problems. Class is being
  organized this way in part to make it easier for individuals or the class as a whole
  to transition to a more asynchronous setting should the need arrise.

  \item Expect most class sessions to be recorded for the benefit of students that
  are unable to attend class due to an excused absense or illness. If you do not wish
  to be recorded, please contant the instructor ASAP to work something out.

  \item You are not required to use video and audio during the class meetings, but it is,
  however, encouraged. The chat channel will be monitored and used during class in order
  to facilitate those without audio. If you choose to use audio, please try to keep
  microphones muted unless you are speaking. If you choose to use video, please ensure
  your space and background do not contain inapropriate nor offensive material. (Just
  assume one of my kids is going to see it.)

  \item Office hours will be carried out via Zoom. Whenever possible, give the
  instructor a heads up if you need or want to meet. If you log into the Zoom meeting
  and the session isn't running or nobody is there, then email or txt and the instructor
  will hop right on.

\end{itemize}

If you have any concerns about getting access to the technology you need to keep up with
remote meetings or generally have questions about class exceptions for this semseter,
then please do not hesitate to ask. The goal here is flexiblity and we try to make
things work for whatever you situation happens to be.

\section{Description, Content, and Learning Goals}

Introduction to Programming teaches basic programming skills that are applicable to a variety of disciplines and also acts as a bridge to continued studies in Computer Science. Students will work with the Python programming language in order to solve basic problems involving digital media: images, sound.  By the end of the course students will be able to read and develop computer programs utilizing the following programming concepts: basic data types and encoding, variables and scope, array and list data structures, if statements and conditional execution, loops and iteration, functions, and object types.

\subsection{Software}

All programming will be done using \textit{Jython Environment for Students (JES)}. This software is avaiable from any campus computer. It is also free to download and install. A link to the latest version will be posted to Moodle and the instructor is happy to help with getting it installed and setup as needed.

\section{Workload}
% number of/details on midterms, finals, project, homeworks, quizes, etc

The course workload is as follows:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \underline{Category} & \underline{Number of Assignments} \\
    Exams & 6 \\
    Projects & 2 \\
    Labs & 10 \\
    Homework & 8
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}


\subsection*{Exams}

All exams are weighted equally. There is no midterm or final exam in the sense that the exams are worth more than other exams or that they will necessarily take longer than other exams.  Exams will generally focus on material covered since the previous exam but will be in some sense cumulative due to the nature of programming. \textit{Exams during this semseter will be administered via Moodle and will have fixed time windows during which they can be completed.}

\subsection*{Projects}

Two larger scale programming projects will be undertaken during the semester. These projects will be individual efforts and will require much more effort than the programs written in lab or as part of homework. Students can expect to have two weeks from the time of the project assignment to complete the project. One or more lab periods will be dedicated to work on the project. It is highly recommend that all students make ample use of the time given on these projects.

\subsection*{Homework}

Students will be assigned a set of problems from each chapter of the book covered in the course. These problems are meant to guide reading, prepare the student for in class problems, and survey the material covered by the exam. \textit{While we are engaging in remote learning, homework problems will be given submitted via Moodle. Some problems will be administered as Moodle Quizzes where others will require submitting written code.}

\subsection*{Labs}

Students will be placed into groups of two or three for each lab. Work will be done using \textit{paired programming}, a programming practice where each member of the group takes turns typing while the other group member helps look for typos, bugs, and otherwise assists in the design of the code. Each group will submit their work at the end of the lab period regardless of the overall completeness of the assignment. The goal is to make good constructive progress on the assignment. Full credit can and will be given on unfinished work so long as it can be executed to complete some portion of the given task, shows evidence of purposeful progress, and the group made full use of the lab period.\footnotemark[3]
\footnotetext[3]{\textbf{We will attempt to maintain this practice using Zoom breakout groups. If it's too awkward we'll find something different. No matter what, labs will be collaborative in nature and you can expect to have a classmate to work with and bounce ideas off of during each lab period.}}

\subsection{Course Engagement Expectations}

The weekly workload for this course will vary by student but on average should be about 13 hours per week.  The follow tables provides a rough estimate of the distribution of this time over different course components.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\underline{Assignment Type} & \underline{Time/week} \\
Lectures+Labs       & 6 hours/week \\
Homework          & 1 hours/week \\
Exam Study Time    & 0.5 hours/week \\
Projects          & 3 hours/week \\
Reading &  2.5 hours/week \\
\bottomrule
 & 13 hours/week
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Grades}

This course uses a standard grading scale where percentage grades translate to letter grades as follows:

\begin{center}
\begin{small}
\begin{tabular}{lcl}
\underline{Score} & & \underline{Grade} \\
94--100 & & A \\
90--93 & & A- \\
88--89 & & B+ \\
82--87 & & B \\
80--81 & & B- \\
78--79 & & C+ \\
72--77 & & C \\
70--71 & & C- \\
68--69 & & D+ \\
62--67 & & D \\
60--61 & & D- \\
0--59 & & F
\end{tabular}
\end{small}
\end{center}


Students are always welcome to challenge a grade that they feel is unfair or calculated incorrectly.  Mistakes made in the student's favor will never be corrected to lower a grade.  Mistakes not in the student's favor will be corrected.  \textit{Basically, after the initial grading, a score can only go up as the result of a challenge.}



\subsection{Grade Weights}

The final grade is based on a weighted average of particular assignment categories.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
  \underline{Category} & \underline{Weight} \\
    Exams & 36\% \\ %6 each
    Projects & 24\% \\ %12 each
    Homework & 10\% \\ %1.25 each
    Labs & 15\% \\ %1.5 each
    Participation & 15\%
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Participation \& Attendance}

Participation grades will be determined based largely on the completion of reading quizzes that come along
with the daily reading and video assignments. Class and lab attendance will be monitored via Zoom. Repeated unexcused absenses will have a negative effect on your participation grade. Whenever possible, let the instructor know of the absence before it occurs. When unexcused absences do occur, it is the student's responsibility to make up for the lost class time and to seek the permission of the instructor to hand-in or complete assignments that are late due to an unexcused absence.

\subsection{Late Work}

In general, assignments are due at the specified time and no late assignments will be accepted unless an extension was requested prior to the due date. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule and students needing extra time can always contact the instructor for an extension. Do not just give up and eat a zero for the assignment. Ever. There is no penalty in asking for an extension nor is there a limit on extensions.  That being said, there is no guarantee an extension will be given without legitimate need.

\subsection{Calendar}

\textit{This calendar is subject to change based on the circumstances of the course.}
